R: Touch 		D: [sum] hours

You touch a corpse and the face peels off like a mask. The rest of the corpse shrivels up and flakes into dust. When you (and only you) wear the mask, you will look and sound like the person whose face you’re wearing. The mask will rot into uselessness after [sum] days. If [dice] is at least 4, the mask is permanent.
