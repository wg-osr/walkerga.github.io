R: Touch  D: 1 Day

A floating disk springs into existence beside you. It always floats 4' above the floor and never exerts any weight on the floor beneath it. It will automatically follow you, always staying  within 5' of you. It can go up stairs and across the surface of water. It has an inventory of [sum] slots.
