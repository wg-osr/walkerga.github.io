R: 1 mile 		D: [dice] rounds

A nearby [dice] HD creature (which must have consciousness and must be living) is called to aid you. It will serve you loyally for [dice] rounds after arrival. 

The creature must physically travel to you, retains memory of all acts committed while under the influence of the spell, and will feel oddly satisfied about serving you afterwards (assuming that the creature’s basic ethos was not violated).
