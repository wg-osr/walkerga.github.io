R: 60'

An object or creature within range is hurled through the air. Save to negate. A human-sized creature travels 10’ per [dice], and takes 1D6 damage for every 10' traveled. A creature thrown at another creature requires an Attack roll to hit and inflicts 1D6 damage for every 10' traveled. This spell will also blow open all the closed but unlocked doors in a room, shatter all the windows, or knock the thatched roof off a peasant's shack.
