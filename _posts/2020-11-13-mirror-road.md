R: Touch	

You, along with [dice] companions, may step into a mirror and travel within the mirror world, which is a twisted reflection of standard reality, emerging from another mirror (which may be selected by you if known beforehand, or is otherwise determined randomly near the desired destination). 

Each exploration turn (10 minutes) of travel within the land of mirrors is equivalent in distance to a day of travel on material roads, though there is a 1 in 6 chance of a random encounter within the mirror world for each such turn oftravel.

If the journey beyond the mirror persists for longer than [dice] turns, there is a 1 in 6 chance cumulative per additional turn that:

1. Denizens of the mirror world emerge along with you at the destination.
1. All mirrors within 100 miles shatter following your emergence.
1. All other mirrors nearby become temporary vortexes, absorbing an object or person into the mirror realm.
1. The destination mirror becomes a permanent gateway to the mirror world.
1. Denizens of the mirror world emerge from all other mirrors nearby.
1. The destination mirror is nowhere near the desired location.
