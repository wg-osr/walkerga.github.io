The target dead body or undead creature you control becomes a conduit to the spirit realm. You can speak messages into it to relay them to the ether, allowing you to communicate with spirits, ghosts, and most forms of undead regardless of linguistic or metaphysical barriers. They can talk back to you and the target translates in a gnarly, rasping monotone.

Two bodies enchanted with Necrophone can be used to relay messages to each other like radios, with no maximum range. If 4 dices are invested in this spell, it becomes permanent.
