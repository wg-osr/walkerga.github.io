R:  30' 

*cephalopomorphosis*

You transform one of your hands into a long tentacle and and grapple something.  Then, you choose one:

- **Crush It!**: It takes [sum] damage and cannot move on its next turn.
- **Throw It!** You shove the target 30' in one direction. It takes [sum] damage and falls prone.
- **Drag It!** You may pull the target closer, or pull yourself closer if the target is heavier.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell and scribe your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon), your hands are permanently transformed. You can then use the aforementioned abilities without spending Spell Dice. In this case, the damage is 1D6.
