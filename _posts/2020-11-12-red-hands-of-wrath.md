title: Red Hands of Wrath
---

**R**: 60’        **D**: 10 minutes

You swap target hands with a wrathful devil’s claws. They inflict [dice]D6 damage and cannot be used for anything else than violence. An unwilling target is allowed a save to resist the effect. The bearer of the hands must save every time it is not doing a violent action to avoid clawing a random target in range instead, itself included.

If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, the effect becomes permanent.
