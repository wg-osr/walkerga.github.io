R: 60’ 		D: [dice] minutes

For the duration of this spell, you link two unoccupied spatial volumes (of about human size) such that things entering either location exist simultaneously in both locations. 

You must concentrate and remain unmoving to maintain the sorcery, and must be able to see both locations. When the spell ends, anything remaining in the folded area is:

1. Duplicated in effigy (wicker, dirt, straw, and the like) at one of the locations
1. Cloned, but insane, and with nonliving elements rendered in lead (but which is the original?)
1. Torn in half, with one half at each point
1. Forced to one of the two points but affected in reverse by gravity forever after.
1. A spatial anchor that maintains the enchantment as long as the object remains in the fold
1. Loses all color permanently (and is shunted to one of the two locations).

If concentration is broken, save or a catastrophe happens.
