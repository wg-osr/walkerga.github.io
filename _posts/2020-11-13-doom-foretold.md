**D**: 1 day

As you make a bold statement about someone’s future, your Sigil brands them in a discreet location. You state [dice] ways the target will _not_ die. From for the duration of the spell, if the target would die from one of these causes, you can either decide to end the spell or gain one [doom point](/list/spell-catastrophe). If a catastrophe is triggered this way, they suffer it instead of you.

If you invest 4 dice or more in this spell, the effect becomes permanent.
