D: [dice] hours

You fall unconscious and possess a clone of yours that forms from nearby ice and snow. The simulacrum has [sum] HP and all other stats as you, but it has none of your equipment or magical abilities. Once the duration of the spell expires or the simulacrum reaches 0 hp, you return to your body. However, if the simulacrum was destroyed, Save or gain a wound. The simulacrum is vulnerable to thawing.
