R: Touch

An organ of your choice blossoms from a pool of blood. It requires a constant supply of fresh blood to function, and will shrivel away by the end of the day. Choose [dice] of the following characteristics for it to exhibit, beyond its expected mundane qualities:

- The organ is unusually larger or unusually smaller than normal.
- While supplied with fresh blood, the organ will not shrivel away.
- The organ has an independent reservoir to store blood, and need only drink it occasionally rather than be constantly supplied.
- The organ is animated, can follow simple commands and move under its own power (classically by means of spindly limbs, but fleshcrafters are a crafty and daring cohort).
