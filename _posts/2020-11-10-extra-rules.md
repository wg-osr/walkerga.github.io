## Eldritch Ink
Before the coming of the end the cunning-folk of **Graft** channeled cosmic power through eldritch signs carved into their skin. All but the most bastardized of these ancient practices have been lost; yet there are a few, the so called **Skingravers**, who have studied these techniques and can tattoo the contents of a scroll on those foolish or practiced enought to attempt their channeling. 
<br>
Though these tattooed scrolls free their bearer from the labor of bearing scrolls, channeling such power directly through one's body is dangerous to the unititated. If you fail while attempting to activate a tattooed scroll, in addition to the power failing, you **lose 1d4 HP** and you become dizzy for the next two hours.
#### It is rumored that some among the skingravers have rediscovered cunning-folk's original art and can create tattoos capable of channeling the power of old.

**The Skingravers charge 50s and a copy of the relevant scroll for their services**
