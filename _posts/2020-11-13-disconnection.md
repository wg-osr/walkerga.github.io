R: 60’		D: 10 minutes

You disconnect [dice] human-sized things from any surface. The smallest push will send disconnected objects and creatures gliding across any ground surface like on wet ice. Any physical interaction by or with a suspended thing requires a save or it falls prone and glides away.
