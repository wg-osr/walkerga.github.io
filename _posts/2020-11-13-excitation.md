You generate a high-energy radiation shock, which energises the target's spent magic dice, and refills them by the same amount of dice you spent. However, if these refuelled magic dice are not used by next round, they fall back to their ground level, and the target [mutates](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html). Unwilling targets are allowed a save.
