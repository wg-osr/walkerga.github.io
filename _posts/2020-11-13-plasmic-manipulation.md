R: 60’ 		D: [dice] hours	

You examine the mind of another person for spells or other plasmic entities and may choose one of the following options:

Steal a spell for later casting. 
Implant (and thus lose) a spell into the target’s consciousness.
Free [dice] number of plasmic entities from the target’s mind (effectively removing spell dices). 

The target of this spell is permitted a saving throw, and if that saving throw is a natural 20 the target may instead raid your mind with recourse to the same three options.
