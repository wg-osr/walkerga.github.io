You, along with [dice] companions, may occupy the same space as another physical object, which must be large enough to contain the largest of the person so affected (unwilling subjects must be physically forced into an object and are permitted a saving throw against the magic). 

While in an object, characters may not move, though they continue to perceive events around them as if filtered through a dim haze. 

The spell subjects may exit and enter objects for the duration of the spell, though you must will this to happen. Subjects always emerge where they entered (thus, the spell may not be used to walk through a wall), and such reemergence occurs automatically when the spell ends.
