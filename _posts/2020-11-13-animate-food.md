D:  [dice] hours

[dice] pieces of food combine and come to life as [sum] HP Food Golem under your control.  It gains a mean of locomotion, the ability to manipulate objects, though this may be limited based on the food's size and initial properties, and the ability to speak one language you know.

If this spell is cast with four or more [dice], the food golem will persist indefinitely until killed.
