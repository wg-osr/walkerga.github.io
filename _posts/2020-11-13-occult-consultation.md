D: [sum] minutes

After a nighttime ritual where you dig a pit two feet square into which is poured wine, fragrant herbs, and the blood of a sacrifice slain with a bronze knife is performed, you call out to the spirit of a dead person. Roll 1D6 + [dice]:

1. You take 2D6 damage and, if this brings you to 0 HP, you are dragged to the underworld.
1. The spirit is now a ghost bound to this place.
1. It’s the wrong spirit!
1. The spirit is mocking and cruel to you.
1. The spirit is answers truthfully...
1. ... and also information you didn’t ask.
1. ... and stays and extra 1D6 minutes.
1. You can command the spirit.

Your roll is modified by these factors:
- Died within a week: +1
- Has unfinished business here: +1
- You know its true name: +1
- You know personally: +4
- Is angry at you: −3
- You only know vaguely who it is: −3
- The target was a magic user: −3

Following the consultation, if desired, you may follow the ghost in katabasis to the land of the dead, along with any number of willing companions, though an easy path of return is not guaranteed.
