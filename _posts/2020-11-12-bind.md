**R**: 60’		**D**: [dice]*10 minutes

You summon invisible, extra-dimensional chains. The chains grapple [dice] creatures who fail a save and are impossible to break free from, even through teleportation. 

Bindings may be set as traps by laying your [Sigil](/spells/#lexicon) on a surface, you decide the trigger. If you invest 4 dice or more in such trap, and target only one creature, the binding becomes permanent.
