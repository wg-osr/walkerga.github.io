R: Touch		D: Sigil

You touch a diseased thing and trap the malady in a previously sigiled potpourri, curing it. As long as you breathe the potpourri's aroma—through a plague-doctor mask for example—you are immune to this specific disease. You can also breathe it on adjacent things to contaminate them [dice] times before the spell depletes. A save is allowed to resist.
