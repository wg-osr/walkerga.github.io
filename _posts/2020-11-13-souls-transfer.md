D: Sigil

Your soul is placed in a talisman like a pendant or an article of clothing marked by your Sigil, leaving the original body behind in stasis. 

While in the talisman, your consciousness remains active and aware of events nearby, and may possess any [dice] HD body that comes in contact with the talisman, though a save is permitted if the possession is resisted. 

If this new body is slain while occupied by your soul, a saving throw is required for your soul to return to the talisman and avoid becoming trapped in the spirit world.
