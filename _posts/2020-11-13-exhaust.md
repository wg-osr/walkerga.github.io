You forcefully blast out a field of radiation along with hot steam that obscures vision. The heat of this steam deals [dice] damage +1 per mutation you have to anyone within the area of effect for each Magic Die you have already used that day. The targets can choose to [mutate](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-1d500-biological-mutations.html) instead of taking damage.
