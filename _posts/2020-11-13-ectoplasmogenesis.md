R: Touch  D: [dice] * minutes

Conjures ectoplasm to restore a damaged object to temporary wholesomeness. The max size of the object is [dice] x 5 square feet of material. The restoration happens fast enough that, for example, if you buried spear splinters beneath the floor they'd impale hapless bandits walking over them when restored.
