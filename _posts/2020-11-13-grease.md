R: 60'  D: [dice] x 10 minutes

You cause an 10-foot square area or [dice] objects to become covered in slippery, flammable grease. To move across the greased area or hold a greased object, one must make a save.  On a failure, they drop the object or fall prone.

If the grease is set ablaze, it inflicts 1D6 damage each round for [dice] rounds before burning completely.
