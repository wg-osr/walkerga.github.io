R: 60’ 		D: 10 minutes

This spell awakens the inner beast, causing the growth of claws and fangs, granting a [dice] bonus to attack, damage, and armor. A saving throw is permitted for the unwilling. 

Any creature so enraged must make a melee attack against the nearest combatant every round in the most violent manner possible. 

When the spell expires, the subject collapses into unconsciousness and exhaustion if a saving throw is failed, and if this saving throw is a natural 1, the subject contracts lycanthropy.
