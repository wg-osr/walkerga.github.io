title: Insectare
---

Space-faring cricket-folk disguised as elves. An aberration.

Imagine a beautiful elf, skin like porcelain. If you could get close, you’d see its eyes are compounded. If you could see under its elaborate scarves and cloak, you’d discover a chitinous insectoid body with joints like a puppet’s. If unmasked, it uncoils two cricket-like body-length antennae.

**HD:** 1  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as chain <br>
**Size:** medium <br>
**Stats:** talented, careful, quick<br>
**Movement:** average<br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

_An insectare veteran would have 3HD and have increased damage die size_

As an aberration, the insectare *resists mind attacks* and *does not die* unless its killer succeeds a save vs fear. Additionally, they can see in the dark and jump 60'.

It is impossible to distinguish a disguised insectare from an elf when not adjacent to it. They are master manipulators.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Saber Jump.</ins> The insectare makes a melee attack (1D6) and jumps 60' away.

<ins>Antennae Whips.</ins> The insectare makes two melee attacks with reach (1D4). On a hit, a target must save or drop its weapon.

<summary>Design Notes</summary>
Insectare are weird! They are a spelljammer race whose shtick is to be pretend to be elves. Like a moth pretending to be an owl but more sinister.</details>
