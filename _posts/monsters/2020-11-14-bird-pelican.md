title: Bird, Giant Pelican
---

Sea birds that swallow whole. A beast.

Imagine a cart-sized seabird with a long pouch-beak.

**HD:** 4  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** none <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** strong and dumb<br>
**Movement:** average, fly fast <br>
**Morale:** coward <br>

Pelicans have a very good sense of sight.

**Attacks (1/round)**

<ins>Swallow</ins>. The pelican makes an attempt to grapple a target. On success, the target is stuck in its beak pouch. While there, it cannot use any weapon bigger than a dagger.

<ins>Subdue</ins>. The pelican squishes its beak pouch on its chest to crush whatever is inside (1D4).

<ins>Gulp</ins>. The pelican skims a water pond and fills its pouch with water. As long as it is filled, creatures inside can't breath or speak.

<ins>Shake</ins>. The pelican violently shakes its head. A creature in its pouch must save or be stunned for a round.

There's not much to salvage from a pelican beyond the meat. A single giant pelican is worth rations for 2 days.
