<img align="right" width=250px src="/images/Abhir.png">

Demonic darkness snake that feeds off martial prowess. An aberration.

Imagine slithering darkness. If you could see inside, there’d be a big snake body with tentacles, hooks and a single eye instead of a head.

It wants the souls of strong warriors to feed its larvae. <br>

**HD:** 6  &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Armor:** as chain <br>
**Size:** large <br>
**Stats:** elite <br>
**Movement:** average <br>
**Morale:** brave <br>

As an aberration, the Abhir *resists mind attacks* and *does not die* unless its killer succeeds a save vs fear. Additionally, as it devours the souls of warriors, the Abhir *resists all weapons* and can *smell strong warriors*. It *sees in the dark* and its immediate surroundings are always engulfed by *complete darkness*.

**Non-combat magic** <br>
Darkness Weaving, Transmetallurgy, Enchantment.

**Attacks (2/round)**

<ins>Cleave.</ins> The abhir makes a melee attack (1D6) against two adjacent targets.

<ins>Ensnare.</ins> The abhir attempts to grapple a target with its tail, dealing damage (1D6) and restraining it. The target takes constitution damage (1D6) each turn while grappled. Only one creature can be grappled at a time.

<ins>Rise and Dive.</ins> The abhir rises on its tail, dives to a nearby point and makes a melee attack (1D6). On a hit, the target drops what it holds.

<ins>Spellcasting (2).</ins> *Levitate, Invisibility Purge, Teleport, Major Image.*

<ins>Tales of Violent Glory.</ins> One creature the abhir can see must save or be charmed.

Your studies of the aberration have changed you in horrible, gruesome ways: you bear the trapped soul of a defeated warrior. It manifests as chitinous armor on ...

1. ... your legs.
1. ... one of your arms.
1. ... your hand, which counts as a one-handed weapon of your choice.
1. ... your chest.
1. ... your face.
1. roll again. You know the [spell word](https://saltygoo.github.io/class/magic-user#spell-words) *Weapon* and gain one spell die.

That specific body part is immune to fire and counts as armored. You cannot wear equipment on this body part.

<summary>DM Notes</summary>
The Abhir is an original DnD monster who only appeared once in [Dungeon Magazine #23](https://annarchive.com/files/Dungeon%20Magazine%20%23023.pdf). It was basically a weaker marilith clone with a darkness spell. When adapting it for my bestiary, I wanted to differentiate it from the marilith for two reasons: first, I find that monster clones cheapen both the original and the creation, and second, I always thought that the marilith looked more like a ruthless devil than a demonic embodiment of chaos. — SaltyGoo
