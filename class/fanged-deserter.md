##### You have thirty or so friends who never let you down: YOUR TEETH. Disloyal, deranged, or simply uncontrollable any group that didn't boot you out, you left anyway. But your parliament of teeth - enormous, potruding, thick, and sharp - have always been your allies.

## Bite 
- DR10 to attack
- d6 damage
- You must be close to your target
- 1 - 2 on d6 chance the enemy gets a free attack.


## Starting Equipment
1. <ins>**Crumpled Monster Mask**</ins> <br>
Striked primitive fear into lesser creatures like goblins, gnomes, and children. While worn, they check morale every round.
2. <ins>**The Brown Scimitar of Galgenbeck**</ins> <br>
A stinking sword you pulled from a military shit-ditch. **1d6 Damage, attack/defence DR10 whilst wielding it.** 1 in 6 chance a wounded enemy is smitten with potent sepsis, dying in 10 minutes
3. <ins>**Wizard Teeth**</ins> <br>
Four wizard teeth rattle within a blackened pouch. Before battle roll a d6 for each one. For every 6, one of your attacks deals maximum damage.
4. <ins>**Old Sigûrd's Sling**</ins> <br>
Sigûrd was the strongest man whose throat you ever gnawed. Woven from his long grey hair, this sling has never failed you. **2d4 damage**, requires fist-sized rocks which, perhaps regrettably, are everywhere.
5. <ins>**Ancient Gore-Hound**</ins> <br>
Asthmatic, deluded, and on its last legs, this wizened creature still has a superb nose and can sniffle up treasure in the most disgusting debris. Becomes frenzied around goblins and beserkers. <br>
**Attack DR10 - Defence DR12 - Bite 1d6 - HP 10**
