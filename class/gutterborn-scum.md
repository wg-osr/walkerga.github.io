##### An ill star smiled upon your birth. Poverty, crime and bad parenting didn't help either. In your community an honest day's work was never an option. Not that you ever tried, what are you, some kind of mug? A razor blade and a moonless night are worth a week of chump-work.

## Abilities
- Small, roll 3d6-2 for Strength
- Stealthy, <ins>all Presence and Agility tests have their DR reduced by 2 (normal tests are DR10 instead of DR12)</ins>

## Getting Better
The first time the Scum gets better another specialty is rolled. From the second time the Scum gets better it's possible to reroll these two specialties or just one.

## Specialties
1. <ins>**Coward's Job**</ins> <br>
When attacking by surprise **test Agility DR10.** On a success you automatically hit once with a light one-handed weapon, dealing normal damage +3
2. <ins>**Filthy Fingersmit**</ins> <br>
Your snaky little digits get into pockets and pick locks with a **DR8 Agility test.** You also begin with lockpicks!
3. <ins>**Abominable Gob Lobber**</ins> <br>
Your phlegm is viscous, lumpy, vile, and ballistacally accurate at short range. You can spit d2 times during a fight. **Roll DR8 Presence test for accuracy.** Targets are blinded, retching, and vomitting for d4 rounds. Anyone witnessing this-friends and foe-must make a **Toughness test** to not also vomit. **PCs test DR10 and enemies DR12.**
4. <ins>**Escaping Fate**</ins> <br>
Every time you use an omen there is a 50% chance it is not spent
5. Excretal Stealth <br>
You have an astounding, almost preternatural ability to hide in muck, debris, and filth. When hidden in these conditions a DR16 test is required to notice you.
6. <ins>**Dodging Death**</ins>
You are so unpleasant, irrelevant, disgusting, and vile even Death would rather avoid you if it can. On death, if there is even the slightest possibility that you survived, there is a 50% chance that you did. If successful, after 10 rounds you pop back up with d4 HP and an unlikely explanation of your escape.
