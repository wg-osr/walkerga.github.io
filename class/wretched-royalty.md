## Royal Equipment 
1. <ins>The Blade of your Ancestors</ins> <br>
This magnifient and clearly magical talking sword is foppish, unreliable, and quietly despises  you. It taunts your failures and, if continually disappointed, develops a 1 in 6 chance to "accidentally" attack you or your companions. **Deals 1d6+1 damage. Attack/Defence DR is 10**
2. <ins>"Poltroon" the Court Jester</ins>
3. <ins>Barbarister the Incredible Horse</ins>
4. <ins>Hamfund the Squire</ins>
5. <ins>The Snake-Skin Gift</ins>
6. <ins>Horn of the Schleswig Lords!</ins>
