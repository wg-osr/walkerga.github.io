##### Bowed down only by the memories of your own lost glory, you could never submit to anyone else. Not you, of noble blood! (Not that you expect any of these peons to understand the depths of your sorrow.)

## Abilites
- Painfully average, you adjust no abilities
- Roll 1d8 on weapons table
- Roll 1d4 on armor table, but reroll if you receive heavy armor..
- You begin with two of the following...

## Royal Equipment 
1. <ins>The Blade of your Ancestors</ins> <br>
This magnifient and clearly magical talking sword is foppish, unreliable, and quietly despises  you. It taunts your failures and, if continually disappointed, develops a 1 in 6 chance to "accidentally" attack you or your companions. **Deals 1d6+1 damage. Attack/Defence DR is 10**
2. <ins>"Poltroon" the Court Jester</ins><br>
While practically useless, personally irritating and an emotional drain, Poltroon's capering actually makes enemies lose their focus in combat. For the first two rounds you and your allies get +2 on attack/defence.
3. <ins>Barbarister the Incredible Horse</ins><br>
Barbarister is magical, intelligent, arrogant, and vain. He can also talk. If you can persuade him to car, Barbarister occasionally adds +2 to Presence tests involving logic and intellect. The horse may be smarter than you and is quite aware of this.
4. <ins>Hamfund the Squire</ins><br>
This intensely cowardly servant acts only as guardian for the scabbard of the cursed sword *Eurikia*. Once per combat, if Ham can be found, Eurikia may be drawn. The sword does **2d6 damage**, and for every swing of Eurikia roll 1d6. On a 1 the squire is slain and Eurikia vanishes forever.
5. <ins>The Snake-Skin Gift</ins><br>
An expensive sandalwood box bound in snakeskin. It contains a seemingly ordinary dagger, wrapped in silk. The dagger does **d4 damage** but on a 1 the target dies immediatly of deadly poison weeping from the blade.
6. <ins>Horn of the Schleswig Lords!</ins> <br>
Once per day release a blare from this dented old trumpet and **test Presence DR12**. One creature may make their next non-combat test an automatic success
