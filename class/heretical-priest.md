##### Hunted by the ***Two-Headed Basilisks*** of the One True Faith, this heretic can be found raving in ruins, traipsing endlessly down dusty roads and desecrating cathedrals by night.

## Heretical Equipment
1. <ins>**Sacred Shepherd's Crook**</ins> <br>
Its head a hook of human bone inscribed with overlapping anti-prayers. This crook hooks through other worlds. Staff does 2d4 damage except to faithless humans.
2. <ins>**Stolen Mire**</ins> <br>
While wearing this *holy* hat the priest's vile body fades, becoming hard to hit in combat **(Defence DR10)**. If pulled over the ears outside of battle the priest becomes nearly invisible, testing stealth against **DR8**.
3. <ins>**List of Sin**</ins> <br>
A long and accurate document cross-referenced against reality to discover unseen evil-doers. **Successful Presence DR10:** A strange light surrounds evil creatures. The List's owner defence with +2 against any being discovered this way.
4. <ins>**The Blasphemous *Nechrubel Bible***</ins> <br>
So intensely blasphemous even the Priests themselves can only peruse it once per day. When read roll a die. <br>
<ins>Even result:</ins> For the rest of the day PCs heal 1d4 after just five minutes of rest<br>
<ins>Odd result:</ins> The priest is plagued by demonic hallucinations. The GM may invent d3 things that only the Priest can see and describe them to the player as if true. This effect ends with sunrise.
5. <ins>**5 Stones taken from Thel-Emas' Lost Temple**</ins> <br>
Cast the stones on the ground. Their pattern reveals if danger lurks in an adjacent room. *The stones can lie.* The Priest **tests Presence DR10** to see if they are true but after failing they cannot test again untl the sun has set.
666.  (snsǝſ قيدنز) Crucifix <br>
#### The crucifix can be used in encounters with the undead as well as lesser trolls and goblins. Check morale (add or subtract the priest's Presence modifier) to see if the creatures bow and kindly remove themselves
