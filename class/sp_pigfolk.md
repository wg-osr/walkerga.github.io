<ins>Starting Equipment</ins><br>
Lumberjack Axe or Meat Cleaver, Leather Armor, Jug of Mud.

<ins>Starting Skills (+5)</ins><br>
Your choice of Butchery, Debauchery or Farming.

For every Pigfolk template you have, one of your Inventory slot is filled with **Fat**.

**A:** Bulk I, Pig Nose I<br>
**B:** Dungeon Cook, Caloric Burn<br>
**C:** Pig Nose II<br>
**D:** Butcher<br>

## Bulk
For each inventory slot you have taken by **Fat**, increase your HP by 1. If you spend the equivalent of a Treasure celebrating while [carousing](/2020/11/09/base-rules/), you can fill one of your Inventory slots with **Fat**. If you don't eat at least two rations per day, you lose 1 layer of **Fat**.

## Pig Nose I
You can smell nearby edible things. This may be hampered by other overwhelming odors and this does not detect diseases and natural poisons.

## Dungeon Cook
If you manage to salvage a balanced meal composed of proteins, vegetables, and starch from the dungeon you are in, each party member recovers 1 [Wound](/2020/11/09/base-rules/) and you can fill one of your Inventory slots with **Fat**.

## Caloric Burn
You can burn a slot of **Fat** to give yourself a bonus of 1D6 on any roll, including damage.

## Pig Nose II
After you eat something, you know if there are other things like it in the dungeon and in which general direction they are. This may be hampered by other overwhelming odors.

## Butcher
When you carry monster meat in your Inventory, all monsters of the same type are [affraid](/2020/11/10/extra-rules/#conditions) of you.
