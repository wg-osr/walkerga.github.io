*The wind from the west. From the sundered land. Rot rides it, and the stench of **blood**. Cursed walker, will you travel there? To **The valley of the Unfortunate Undead**? Our young ones are taken by the child-thief **Tergol**, known for his vile crimes and alchemy of flesh.*


#### The Calender of Nechrubel
*The world trembles. One can feel it in ways sharp and subtle, mysterious and clear. One by one, inevitable events demaind their place.*<br>
The **GM** rolls a dice each dawn. A result of 1 activates one misery. When the seventh misery is rolled, the world finally dies. The seventh seal is broken for the seventh and final time. The game and your lives end here.

# RELIGION

The dominant religion in the Dying World is the **Church of The One True Faith**. This faith, which took hold 300 years ago, dominates most of the known world. **HE** killed most gods, except for those already lost or dying, and wiped their memories from the world. It is those lost and dying gods who are secretly worshipped and praised behind closed doors.

### One True Faith

<details markdown=1><summary>History</summary>
In the year 565 **Anuk Schleger**, a monk of the Creton Order, encountered the basilisk **Verhu** and set down his whispered prophecies. These lost texts became known as the *Nameless Scriptures*. 300 years later, while working on a new cathedral, *The Two-Headed Basilisks*, an orthodox branch of the Creton Order uncovered Schleger's tomb and with it the Scriptures. Since then all events described within have come to pass. The prophecies are absolutely, factually true and have, thus, supplanted all other Scripture.

<details markdown=1><summary>The Basilisks</summary>
<ins>The Basilisks</ins> are two and two-headed. Hundreds of years ago **SHE** crawled out of Bergen Chrypt and eventually spawned **HE**. The four heads have argued ever since <br>

**SHE** [*First of the Basilisks*]
  - Lusi - Head of denial
  - Arkh - Head of Deception, claims to be the first prophet of truths now prostituted by Verhu
 
**HE** [*The piles of gold-gift riches from Verhu's faithful teeter and slide, so tall are they*]
  - Gorgh - Bitter, rank with envy
  - <ins>Verhu</ins> - Damned Truth, whisperer of the prophecy

It is Verhu who prophesized the seven miseries and the inevitable end of the world. It is his words which were transcribed and then formed into the Nechrubel Calender

**The Church of the One True Faith** answers to the Arch-Priestess Josilfa Migol.<br>
Directly under her command are **The Creton Order**, an elite order comprised of those who have decided to dedicate their lives to the church. They are responsible for spreading influence, maintaining control, rooting out heresy, among other "noble" quests.
