*The wind from the west. From the sundered land. Rot rides it, and the stench of **blood**. Cursed walker, will you travel there? To **The valley of the Unfortunate Undead**? Our young ones are taken by the child-thief **Tergol**, known for his vile crimes and alchemy of flesh.*


## The Calender of Nechrubel
*The world trembles. One can feel it in ways sharp and subtle, mysterious and clear. One by one, inevitable events demaind their place.*<br>
The **GM** rolls a dice each dawn. A result of 1 activates one misery. The seventh misery is rolled, the world finally dies. The seventh seal is broken for the seventh and final time. The game and your lives end here.

# RELIGION

Most of those in power follow **The One True Faith**, forcing their subjects to follow as well. All other religions, cults, or anything the church deems is heresy and those guilty are subject to death. Lurking in the shadows, loyal followers of dead and lost gods are worshipped and praised.
