*The wind from the west. From the sundered land. Rot rides it, and the stench of **blood**. Cursed walker, will you travel there? To **The valley of the Unfortunate Undead**? Our young ones are taken by the child-thief **Tergol**, known for his vile crimes and alchemy of flesh.*



## The Calender of Nechrubel
*The world trembles. One can feel it in ways sharp and subtle, mysterious and clear. One by one, inevitable events demaind their place.*<br>
The **GM** rolls a dice each dawn. A result of 1 activates one misery. The seventh misery is rolled, the world finally dies. The seventh seal is broken for the seventh and final time. The game and your lives end here.

### RELIGION
<ins>The Basilisks</ins> are two and two-headed. The four heads have argued for hundreds of years.

**SHE** 
  - Lusi - Head of denial
  - Arkh - Head of Deception
 
**HE**
  - Gorgh - Bitter, rank with envy
  - <ins>Verhu</ins> - Damned Truth, whisperer of the prophecy 

It is Verhu who prophesized the seven miseries and the inevitable end of the world. It is his words which word transcribed and then formed into the Nechrubel Calender
