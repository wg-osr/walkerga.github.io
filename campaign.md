##### What has happened so far

The party met at the Bloody Cliff Tavern & Inn to meet with <ins>Alcest of Schleswig</ins> to learn more about his request. He is looking for a specific book only found in the Stygian Library
but it is much too dangerous for him alone. <br>
He is offering 200s per person to enter into the Stygian Library and bring him back the book. He will pay more money if the party is able to bring back a specific spell scroll. <br>
