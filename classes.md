<summary>Design Notes</summary>
*I really agree with Dungeon Antology's [vision of class design](https://dungeonantology.com/2020/08/09/glog-class-design/). I aim to have few yet impactful abilities for them, and for the classes to fulfil at least one of the 3 classic roles of DnD. â€” SaltyGoo*

*A fighter-type class is designed to be good in combat situations. A specialist-type class is designed to be good in non-combat situations. A wizard-type class is designed to change the situation.*
