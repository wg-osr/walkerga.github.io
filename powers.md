#### A few so-called Powers are known and they are usually found written in scrolls.

- Roll Presence + d4 every morning to determine how many times you can use Powers that day; choose from your available scrolls.
- When reading a scroll, test Presence DR12. 
  - If you succeed, the Power is activated and you subtract on from your daily total.
  - If you fail, the Power doesn't work, you lose d2 HP and you become dizzy for the next hour. During this time, Powers will always fail in the worst possible way
