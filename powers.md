#### A few so-called Powers are known and they are usually found written in scrolls.

- Roll Presence + d4 every morning to determine how many times you can use Powers that day; choose from your available scrolls.
- When reading a scroll, test Presence DR12. 
  - If you succeed, the Power is activated and you subtract on from your daily total.
  - If you fail, the Power doesn't work, you lose d2 HP and you become dizzy for the next hour. During this time, Powers will always fail in the worst possible way

## The Tablets of Ochre Obscurity
**Made from the clay** of *Thee Valley of the Unfortunate Undead*, these Ochre Tablets are relics of a forgotten mind-cult so rare they can be sold for 100s. Each tablet counts as a normal-sized item. If a PC fumbles an attack/defense one tablet breaks. Otherwise, they follow the same usage rules as scrolls. <br>
The coded glyphs are challenging to comprehend; PCs wielding their Power must have Presence +3 (minimum) or be a Forlorn Philosopher

1. **Dream Theory** - The target begins to doubt it is real. Attacking and defending against it is -2DR (+2 DR for affected PCs)
2. **Total Matter Comprehension** - Mends or breaks a normal-sized item, mundane or otherwise, including armor (increase/decrease one tier) and weapons.
3. **Ping the Shared Subconscious** - You sense the presence of living creatures within 70ft even in adjacent rooms.
4. **Logical Prognostication** - Using Pure Logic you can deduce the nature of any traps or mechanisms within 30ft <ins>or</ins> of any Powers used within 60ft
5. **Carno-Organic Speleophagy** - Transmogrifies a child-sized rock into burnt, chewy meat. Feeds d4 famished people.
6. **Time-Locked Pneumotoxin** - This cracked tablet can be crushed to a coarse powder. If strewn upon a creature it takes d6 damage - on a 6 it chokes and dies. The table reappears each morning in its owner's possession. This Power's Presence test is harmless to the wielder, determing whether or not the powder finds the target
7. **Induced Irrelevance** - This tablet's code literally removes a creature's essential meaning for d4 rounds. During which enemies will not attack it, even if it attacks them first
8. **Structural Cryo-condensation (Freezing Moon)** - Water freezes from the air forming a 15ft long bridge or all water within 150ft (unfortunately excluding that within living creatures) freezes
9. **Meta-Alchemy** - The user may transform a container of liquid one of the following ways:
    -Transmute it into two doses of Red or Black poison
    - Create *The Loathing of Vulark*. The imbiber rolls a DR16 Toughness test or jumps from from great heights
    - Transform poison to water or wine
10. **Memetic Cognitive Palpitation** - Near-imperceptible body shifts transmit a simple mind-plague which causes one creaturer to dadnce madly for d4 rounds. They may neither attack nor defend during this choreomania
